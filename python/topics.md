# Python Topics for Data Analyst (Job-Ready & Interview-Focused)

##1. Python Basics (Solid Foundation)

* Variables, Data Types
* Input/output
* Operators (arith, comparison, logical)
* Conditional statements (`if/elif/else`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Functions (definition, parameters, return)
* Error handling (`try/except`)

✔ Why important: almost every assignment/project/interview checks basics.


##   2. Data Structures (Very Important)

* Lists (append, extend, slicing, list comprehension)
* Tuples
* Sets & Dictionaries

  * `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`, iteration
  * `.union()`, `.update()`, `.remove()`
* Strings (split, replace, find, strip)

✔ Used in cleaning, data manipulation, parsing data.



##   3. File Handling

* Reading/Writing text files, CSV, JSON
* `with open(...)`
* `csv` & `json` modules

✔ Every analyst handles datasets.



##   4. Python + Data Analysis Libraries (Core Skill)

###   **NumPy**

* Arrays
* Broadcasting
* Indexing & slicing
* Mathematical functions
* Aggregations (sum, min, max, mean)

###   **Pandas**

* DataFrame, Series
* Reading CSV/Excel
* Filtering rows (`loc`, `iloc`)
* Handling missing values (`dropna`, `fillna`)
* GroupBy & Aggregations
* Merging & joining
* Sorting
* Applying functions (`apply`, `map`)
* Pivot tables

✔ Pandas is a must-have for 90% of data analyst jobs.



##   5. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Removing duplicates, null values
* Handling outliers
* Data transformation
* Encoding categorical data
* Type conversions
* Date/time `handling` (`pd.to_datetime`, `.dt` functions)

This is real daily work of an analyst.



##   6. Data Visualization (Must)

* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
    * Line, Bar, Scatter, Box, Histogram, Heatmap
    * Styling, labels, legends
    * Multiple charts on same figure

✔ Used for insights, dashboards, reports.



##   7. Basic Statistics for Data Analysts

* Mean, median, mode
* Standard deviation, variance
* Correlation
* Probability basics
* Normal distribution
* Sampling & confidence basics

✔ Job descriptions often mention: *"Statistical knowledge required"*.



##   8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Summary statistics
* Data profiling
* Correlation matrix
* Outlier detection
* Feature understanding

✔ Used in interviews and real business cases.



##   9. SQL with Python (Preferred)

* Using `sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy`
* Fetching data from databases into pandas

✔ Many companies need analysts who can query databases + analyze in Python.


##   10. Automation & Scripting

* Automating Excel/CSV tasks
* Scheduled scripts
* Email automation (optional)

✔ Analysts automate repetitive tasks.


##   11. Working with APIs (Nice to Have)

* Calling APIs using `requests`
* Parsing JSON data

✔ Useful for real-time or online data sources.


##   12. Mini Projects (Very Important for Resume)

  Sales data analysis
  Retail or ecommerce data cleaning & visualization
  Customer churn analysis
  HR employee dataset analysis
  IPL/Cricket/Stock data analysis
  Dashboard using matplotlib/seaborn

✔ Recruiters love practical projects more than theory.



#   How this matches job descriptions:

Most JD lines include things like:

✔ “Strong knowledge of Python & Pandas”
✔ “Experience with data cleaning and analysis”
✔ “Ability to visualize insights”
✔ “Knowledge of statistics”
✔ “Work with CSV/Excel files”
✔ “Use NumPy & Pandas for analysis”
✔ “Automate reports using Python”
✔ “SQL is an advantage”

This roadmap covers all of them
